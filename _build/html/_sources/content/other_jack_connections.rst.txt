Other JACK Connections
######################

In the *Other Jack Connections* screen, JACK audio and MIDI port pairs between
other clients (not belonging to Konfyt) can be set up as persistent connections or
disconnections.

Adding a port pair as a "make" will persistently keep the ports connected, even
when another app tries to disconnected it, when other clients restart or when 
hardware devices are reconnected.

Adding a port pair as a "break" will persistently keep the ports disconnected,
i.e. break the connection.
