Library
#######

The library on the left-hand side of the Konfyt window provides quick access
to patches, SFZ and soundfont instruments on your computer.

To populate the library with instruments, a scan must first be performed from 
the settings screen. When you add new instruments to the directories, you have
to initiate a scan again to refresh the library.

The library organizes sounds using the subdirectories in the scanned folders.
Thus, for easy navigation it is useful to sort your sounds into subfolders, 
for example using categories like Piano, Strings, Organs, Pads, etc.

When selecting a soundfont, the list of programs appear below the library tree. 
By double-clicking on a soundfont program, a SFZ or a patch in the library, 
the instrument is added as a layer to the current patch.

When searching the library, file names as well as program names within 
soundfonts are searched. When selecting a soundfont in the search results, only
those programs that match the search terms are shown.

Previewing
----------

The *Preview* button toggles preview mode, allowing you to preview the currently
selected library item without loading it into a project patch.
MIDI input and audio output is routed to and from the selected instrument, 
based on the settings in the preview drop down menu. 
When preview mode is disabled, the instrument is unloaded.
